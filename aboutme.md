This website is to host the tools developed by [Environmental Chemistry and Public Health Research Group](https://people.bath.ac.uk/bkh20/) at [Department of Chemistry](https://www.bath.ac.uk/departments/department-of-chemistry/) in [University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk/), UK.

We are using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), an open-source programming language for statistical analysis to import, tidy, transform, visualise, model and communicate data. R is central to our workflow because it provides an efficient and reproducible way of working that encourages both openness and collaboration.
